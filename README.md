# RLBot

## Running the project

Before you can build & run the RLBot client you need to generate the API client. To do this first run the Controller API.

Navigate to RLBotController/ControllerAPI/Src/Controller.Application and run

```
dotnet run
```

Once the API is running you can now build & run the client

In the RLBot directory run

```
./gradlew run
```
